# Action Recognition Model using Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an action recognition model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model is trained and tested on a provided dataset, which is available in the 'data' directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or above it
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the action recognition model is available in the 'data' directory. It includes labeled examples of various actions captured from video footage.

**Note:** Due to file size limitations, the dataset is hosted on Google Drive. You can download it from [here](link_to_dataset_on_google_drive).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/SairajRajput12/Action-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Download the dataset from the provided Google Drive link and place it in the 'data' directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook 'Final Approach.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build and train the ANN model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
   - Make predictions on new data.

## Note
- Ensure that you have sufficient computational resources (CPU/GPU) to train the model, especially if working with a large dataset.
- Feel free to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance.
